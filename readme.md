### Coding Style

You can use [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) to synchronize this project coding style.

### TODO

 - rename BidOfferToSell => ItemOffer, BidDemand => BidOffer and BidOffer to OfferResponse (or any better idea because I think names are not relevant) ?
 - web : provide a user page to update informations (name, avatar, etc.)
 - web : as a visitor, I should see graph of values of each items
 - web : as a user i should see my collection changes as I acquire items (needs a browser refresh at the moment)
 - game : how much items / how much "value"
